## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The styles for this took a bit of time to put together but the final design turned out to be great. The main goal of this project was to incorporate JavaScript in an intuitive way and the list items allowed me to do that. Li elements are added to the list dynamically and capped at a certain amount. I enjoyed figuring out how to insert elements into the DOM thru Javascript.
